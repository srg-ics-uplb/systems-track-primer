# Systems Track Primer

This resource is for incoming MSCS/MIT students at the UPLB-ICS who would like to specialize in Systems. Topics in Systems include: Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Distributed Systems, Networks, Security, Compilers, and Virtual Machines.

In general, **the goal of Systems is to understand how software and hardware interact and how to design efficient, robust, and secure systems**.

The essay by James Mickens, [*The Night Watch*](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf), talks about what Systems people do compared to other 'computer' people.

## Textbooks  

The following textbooks cover the major topics in Systems. Textbooks are foundational resources. If you've understood (or even mastered) the contents of these textbooks, reading advanced and specialized technical materials, like conference papers and journal papers, will be easier.

* Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (*Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron*)
* Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (*John L. Hennesy and David A. Patterson*)
* Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (*Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau*) 
* Data Communications and Networking (*Behrouz A. Forouzan*)
* Distributed Systems (*Maarten Van Steen and Andrew S. Tanenbaum*)
* The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling (*Raj Jain*)
* Computer Security: Principles and Practice (*William Stallings and Lawrie Brown*) 
* (Optional) The C Programming Language (*Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie*)
