# Systems Track Primer

This resource is for incoming MSCS/MIT students at the UPLB-ICS who would like to specialize in Systems. Topics in Systems include: Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Distributed Systems, Networks, Security, Compilers, and Virtual Machines.

In general, **the goal of Systems is to understand how software and hardware interact and how to design efficient, robust, and secure systems**.

The essay by James Mickens, [*The Night Watch*](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf), talks about what Systems people do compared to other 'computer' people.

My old [blog post](https://blog.jachermocilla.org/2013/07/introductory-readings-in-systems.html) on some essential readings on Systems.

## Textbooks  

The following textbooks cover the major topics in Systems. Textbooks are foundational resources. If you've understood (or even mastered) the contents of these textbooks, reading advanced and specialized technical materials, like conference papers and journal papers, will be easier.

* Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (*Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron*)
* Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (*John L. Hennesy and David A. Patterson*)
* Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (*Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau*) 
* Data Communications and Networking (*Behrouz A. Forouzan*)
* Distributed Systems (*Maarten Van Steen and Andrew S. Tanenbaum*)
* The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling (*Raj Jain*)
* Computer Security: Principles and Practice (*William Stallings and Lawrie Brown*) 
* (Optional) The C Programming Language (*Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie*)


## Conferences and Workshops
The following conferences and workshops are venues where the state-of-the-art in Systems are presented and published.  


* SOSP – Symposium on Operating Systems Principles

## Journals
Journals are usually used in other disciplines for archival purposes. Some conference papers 
become journal papers after additional reviews. In Systems, papers in top conferences are more 
prestigious/impactful than journal papers.  


* TOCS - ACM Transactions on Computer Systems
* TC - IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC)
* JSS - Journal of Systems and Software
* CAL - IEEE Computer Architecture Letters
* TACO - ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)
* TCC - ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)
* TOS - ACM Transactions on Storage 
* JPDC - Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing
* TOPS - ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security
* TDSC - IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing 
* TON - IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking 
* Computer Networks (Elsivier)
* Performance Evaluation (Elsevier)
* Software: Practice and Experience (SPE)
* Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience (CCPE)

## Professional Organizations and Interest Groups

* USENIX Association

* ACM SIGSAC: Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control
* IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer Architecture (TCCA)

## Tools

### Linux
A good understanding of the Linux kernel and its ecosystem is essential in Systems. You can install Linux (any distribution) on your 
main machine or on a VM. Mastery of the command line interface and shell are also important including the build tools. (https://kernel.org)

### Wireshark 
A great tool for analyzing network packets. (https://www.wireshark.org/)
