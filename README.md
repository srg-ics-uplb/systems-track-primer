# Systems Track Primer

This resource is for incoming MSCS/MIT students at the UPLB-ICS who would like to specialize in Systems. Topics in Systems include: Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Distributed Systems, Networks, Security, Compilers, and Virtual Machines.

In general, **the goal of Systems is to understand how software and hardware interact and how to design efficient, robust, and secure systems**.

The essay by James Mickens, [*The Night Watch*](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf), talks about what Systems people do compared to other 'computer' people.

## Textbooks  

The following textbooks cover the major topics in Systems. Textbooks are foundational resources. If you've understood (or even mastered) the contents of these textbooks, reading advanced technical materials like conference papers and journal papers will be easier.

* Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (*Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau*) 
* Computer Systems: A programmers Perspective (*Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron*)
* Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (*John L. Hennesy and David A. Patterson*)
* Data Communications and Networking (*Behrouz A. Forouzan*)
* Distributed Systems (*Maarten Van Steen and Andrew S. Tanenbaum*)
* Computer Security: Principles and Practice (*William Stallings and Lawrie Brown*) 
* (Optional) The C Programming Language (*Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie*)
